PUSH1 0x20
PUSH1 0x00
RETURN

/*

This is a sequence of EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode instructions. Here's a brief explanation of what each instruction does:

1. `PUSH1 0x28`: This pushes the byte value 0x28 (which is 40 in decimal) onto the stack.
2. `PUSH1 0x02`: This pushes the byte value 0x02 (which is 2 in decimal) onto the stack.
3. `ADD`: This pops the top two elements from the stack, adds them, and pushes the result back onto the stack. In this case, it would add 40 and 2 to get 42.
4. `MSTORE`: This pops the top two elements from the stack, interprets the first as a memory address and the second as a value, and stores the value at the memory address. In this case, it would store the value 42 at memory address 0.
5. `RETURN`: This halts execution and returns the data in memory specified by the top two items on the stack. In this case, since there are no items left on the stack, it would return an error.

Please note that this is a very simplified explanation. The actual behavior of these instructions can be more complex and depends on the current state of the EVM.


--------

The code you've provided is written in Ethereum's low-level language, EVM bytecode. It's not typically written by hand, but generated by compilers like Solidity. However, if you want to correct this code to store the sum of 0x28 and 0x02 in memory and then return it, you need to specify the memory locations for `MSTORE` and `RETURN`. Here's a corrected version:

```plaintext
PUSH1 0x28			// [40]
PUSH1 0x02			// [2]
ADD					// pop [2], pop [40], 40 + 2 = 42, push [42]
PUSH1 0x00			// push [0]
MSTORE				// pop [42] et pop [0], store 42 dans la memory a l'adresse 0
PUSH1 0x20			// push [32]
PUSH1 0x00			// push [0]
RETURN				// return 32 bytes de l'adresse 0
```

==> dans les arguments de MSTORE et RETURN, toujours l'adresse en premier, d'ou le fait de la push en dernier dans la stack

Here's what this code does:

1. `PUSH1 0x28` and `PUSH1 0x02` push the values 0x28 (40 in decimal) and 0x02 (2 in decimal) onto the stack.
2. `ADD` pops these two values, adds them, and pushes the result (42) back onto the stack.
3. `PUSH1 0x00` pushes the memory location 0x00 onto the stack.
4. `MSTORE` pops the top two values from the stack, interprets the first as a memory address and the second as a value, and stores the value at the memory address. In this case, it stores 42 at memory address 0.
5. `PUSH1 0x00` and `PUSH1 0x20` push the start memory location and the size of the data to be returned onto the stack.
6. `RETURN` pops these two values and returns the data in memory starting at the specified address and of the specified size. In this case, it returns the 32 bytes of data starting at memory address 0.
